# first_django_project
The first Django project I wrote when taking Mosh's Ultimate Django Course! 

Thanks for looking at my first Django project! This is the culmination of 
300 lessons in a 15 hour Django course from Mosh Hamedani.

In Part One of the course I learned:
We learned how to build function-based views, 
build a data model, set up the database, 
how to use Django's ORM, 
and customized the Admin site.

In Part Two of the course I dove into:
We implemented Django Rest Framework to build a RESTful API,
learned more about API concepts (nested routers, pagination, filtering, searching), 
switched over from function-base views to viewsets while learning how they build upon each other through generic views and mixins, 
learned how to secure our API with Djoser and JWT while applying custom permissions, 
and continued building our application by adding a functional shopping cart and order endpoints.

Finally in Part Three, Mosh briefly introduced many topics:
uploading, validating, and returning media,
using a fake SMTP server,
running background tasks with Celery and Redis,
testing our application's behaviour, not implementation,
stress-testing our application with Locust and investigating it with Silk,
the benefits of caching using Redis, 
reconfiguring our project to make it production-ready,
and deploying our project to Heroku.
